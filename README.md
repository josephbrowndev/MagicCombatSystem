### Meaningful Progression
Every action grants mastery experience. Higher mastery provides tangible benefits like reduced costs and increased power.

### Mentor Relationships
Building relationships with mentors unlocks new abilities and combination magics. The journey to mastery involves both combat practice and mentor interaction.
